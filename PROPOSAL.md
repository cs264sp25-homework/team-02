# Project Proposal

We are building a personal profile and resume management platform that allows users to store multiple versions of their resumes and store answers for common open-ended job application questions. It will also include AI features such as creating tailored resumes and cover letters based on user uploaded resumes and inputted job description.

## Functional Requirements

### General Features

- Create an account and sign in
- Organize your resumes based on custom categories (industry/companies)
- Upload PDF resume (can upload multiple resumes if applying to different job categories)
- Organize answers to common behavioral questions in job applications
- Make user profiles from user-inputted data
- Add work history, skills, and projects to user profile

The following features could be implemented, if time permits:

- Import personal info and work history for profile from Linkedin
- Upload profile picture
- personalized resume review checklist
- we can add notes to job application info (stuff i want to keep in mind about this company like memorize Amazon leadership principles for Amazon related jobs)

The following features would be nice to have but won't be implemented:

- create an extension to autofill any job application with AI
- job tracker with deadlines

### AI Features

- Generates a tailored resume based on uploaded resume and copy-pasted job description
- Can come up with a personalized response to interview question inputted by user
- Personal AI Insights â€“ strengths and weaknesses of your skills based on applied job
  - Basically if i am trying to apply to marketing manager job and have only SWE internships then AI will tell me that i need more experience in marketing and suggest me some activities i can do to gain experience (based on resume)

The following features could be implemented, if time permits:

- generate a cover letter based on job description and user built profile
- AI can also suggest activities or skills to gain based on your career goals

The following features would be nice to have but won't be implemented:

- conduct mock interview with you
- generate Mock technical questions based on job description

### Tech Stack

To align with the technology stack used in the Practical Gen AI course, we'll use the following:

1. React for the frontend framework
2. TailwindCSS and Shadcn UI for styling
3. Nanostores and its router libraries for state management and routing
4. Vite for development
5. Convex BaaS for backend services, including authentication and database
6. Use Vercel's AI SDK as a thin abstraction layer for AI features.
   - Ideally, we will not use more complex abstraction (like LangChain or LlamaIndex) to orchestrate AI features, unless necessary.

## Project Roadmap

Later, after approval, we will create a detailed project roadmap.
