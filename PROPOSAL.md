# Project Proposal

We are building an AI-powered job application builder app designed to streamline the process of filling out job applications and crafting resumes for specific positions through smart resume generation, AI-generated job application responses, and intelligent AI assistant. Our app will enable users to create perfect resumes tailored to inputted job descriptions and leverage AI to efficiently generate impactful responses to questions about user's background and abilities in job applications.

## Functional Requirements

### Primary Features (Must Have)

As a user, I want to:

1. Create an account and sign in through LinkedIn so I can securely access my job application materials and personal responses
2. Create a profile with work history, skills, and education
3. Upload resume in PDF format
4. Import job title, requirements, and job application questions from uploaded links and images.
5. Input my answers to job application questions and be able to select from different options for AI to improve my answers.
6. Generate tailored resume based on uploaded resume and copy-pasted job description
7. Get AI to generate personalized answers for web-scraped questions about my background and capability based on profile information and uploaded resume.
8. View a list of imported jobs and be able to either see my job applicatino responses generated by AI or customize resume for the job.

### Secondary Features (Should Have)

As a user, I want to:

1. Get AI feedback on whether the job that I am considering applying for is a goof fit for my current experience and skills (essentially, you put a link to the job posting and we will perform web scraping and then give you feedback on whether you should apply or not)
2. Generate personal insights from AI on what experience/skills I am lacking to become a competitive candidate for the job
3. Get recommendations from AI on activities I can do to fill in those gaps in my resume (e.g. if I want to apply to a Marketing Coordinator position but I have only SWE internships on my profile and resume, then AI will tell me that I need to gain more experience in marketing and suggest me some activities I can do to become a more competitive candidate)
4. Generate a message introducing oneself and expressing interest in open position that can be sent to hiring manager or recruiter who posted the job posting on LinkedIn.

### Tertiary Features (Nice to Have)

As a user, I want to:

1. Autofill repetitive job application questions with browser extension
2. Bookmark jobs and track my search with a tailored job tracker
3. Generate potential technical and non-technical interview questions based on job description
4. Get notifications for when to submit the job application and for when to follow up on messages sent to recruiter

### Won't Have Features

As a user, I want to:

1. Practice for my interviews with AI as my mock interviewer asking generated expected interview questions

### Tech Stack

To align with the technology stack used in the Practical Gen AI course, we'll use the following:

1. React for the frontend framework
2. TailwindCSS and Shadcn UI for styling
3. Nanostores and its router libraries for state management and routing
4. Vite for development
5. Convex BaaS for backend services, including authentication and database
6. Use Vercel's AI SDK as a thin abstraction layer for AI features.
   - Ideally, we will not use more complex abstraction (like LangChain or LlamaIndex) to orchestrate AI features, unless necessary.
7. Netlify for deployment
